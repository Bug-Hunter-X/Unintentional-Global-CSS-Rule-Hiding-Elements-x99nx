The solution involves using more specific CSS selectors to target only the intended elements, potentially including ID selectors to make the selection more precise, or creating a separate class for elements that should always be hidden.

Here's an example of a possible solution (using ID selector):

```css
#my-modal.modal { /* This will target only the modal with ID my-modal*/
display: none;
}

.modal {
  /* Add other styles for the modal class */
display: block; /* Ensure the modal is visible unless explicitly hidden */
}
```

Another example is creating a separate class:

```css
.always-hidden {
  display: none;
}

.modal {
  /* Add other styles for the modal class */
display: block;
}
```
Then you can apply class `always-hidden` to the elements that you always want to be hidden.
