The CSS rule `.class-name { display: none; }` is applied globally to all elements with the class `class-name`, which might unintentionally hide elements you want to display. This is a common issue when using global selectors. For example, if you have a class such as `modal` that you intend to use for modals in different parts of your site and want to display them conditionally, using the `display: none;` rule for the entire class might hide them unnecessarily.
